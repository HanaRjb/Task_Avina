Drug Q&A System with RAG

This project implements a question-answering system in the pharmaceutical domain using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages BM25 and TF-IDF for retrieving relevant text chunks from a PDF document and uses the Llama-3.1-8B-4bit model for generating precise answers.
Key Features

    Data Extraction & Preprocessing:
    Extracts text from a PDF (Drugs.pdf) and splits it into manageable chunks after cleaning.

    Information Retrieval:
    Uses BM25 (k1=1.6, b=0.7, epsilon=0.25) and TF-IDF to identify the most relevant chunks based on the query, combining their scores equally.

    Answer Generation:
    The Llama-3.1-8B-4bit model generates concise and context-aware answers from the retrieved text.

    Web Interface:
    A simple Gradio interface allows users to input questions and view real-time answers.

    Evaluation:
    Model performance is evaluated using Exact Match (EM) and F1-Score metrics.
